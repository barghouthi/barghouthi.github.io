I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
* footnotes will be placed here. This line is necessary
I bet you'd like more information about this sentence [^1].

[^1]: Well lucky for you, I've included more information in footnote form.

{:footnotes}

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}
